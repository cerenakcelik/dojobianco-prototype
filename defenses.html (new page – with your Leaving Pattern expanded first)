    <h1>Defense Mechanisms — Meeting Our Protectors with Compassion</h1>
    <p class="muted">All defenses are adaptations of love. Each formed to protect early vulnerability; each seeks joy once safety is restored. As we meet them, we move from survival to embodiment, from defense to creative expression.</p>
